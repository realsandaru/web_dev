        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"> Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a 
            sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit,
            such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. 
            The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and 
            prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth,
            semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as 
            its temperature increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type of rich ice cream. Soft serve is softer and is often 
            served at amusement parks and fast-food restaurants in the United States. Ice creams made from cow's milk 
            alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk, 
            or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan. Banana 
            "nice cream"[a] is a 100% fruit-based vegan alternative. Frozen yoghurt, or "froyo", is similar to ice cream 
            but uses yoghurt and can be lower in fat. Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are often available
            in ice cream shops.

        <h3>Ice Cream Sales Data</h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be 
            purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities 
            from ice cream shops.

        <h3>Ice Cream Stories</h3>
        <p>
            In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes 
            referred to as "Philadelphia style"[74] ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes 
            called "French ice cream". American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 
            10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year—the most in the world. 
            According to the NPD Group, the most popular ice cream flavours in the U.S. are vanilla and chocolate with 
            a combined market share of 40% as of 2008
