            <h2>Pax Romana</h2>
            <p>The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana 
                ("Roman Peace"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and 
                economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were 
                infrequent and put down "mercilessly and swiftly".[38] </p>

            <h2>What is the Roman Empire</h2>
            <p>The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans conquered
                 most of this during the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Octavian's assumption of effective sole
                  rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of 
                  Constantinople in 1453.
                By 100 BC, Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely 
                destabilized by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark 
                Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom 
                in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power (imperium) and the new title
                 of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into
                  senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which
                   belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.</p>
