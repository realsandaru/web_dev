Greetings !!

Here i have completed** the Task 2.3P, 4.1P, 5.1P. 6.1P, 7.1P, 7.2P of your assignment.The steps 1, 2 and 3.2 of 2.3P have been completed and the relavent html files and the screenshots are provided here.
step 3.1 of 2.3P has to be done from your end since it is refering to a "Deakin webserver" to which i dont have access to. 
4.1P is completed but there are few places where the problem statement seems to be contradicting it self.In such cases i gave priority to the "Requirements" over other content.
Ill be adding the other tasks to this repo in the future.


p.s - ignore the .gitignore file ( im excluding the node server and the ice cream images there).
let me know if there are any issues.

Check before uploading !!.
Noice.
